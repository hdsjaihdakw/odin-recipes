    <h2>Fried Chicken Wings Dish</h2>
    <p>
      These crispy fried chicken wings are lovely and juicy inside. This recipe
      works so well because the wings are chilled before frying, which gives
      them extra crispy skin. I coat them in Buffalo sauce and they taste
      absolutely wonderful!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>12 small chicken wings</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground paprika</li>
      <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>
        1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's), or to
        taste
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.</li>
      <li>
        Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a
        wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange
        in a single layer on a large plate. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to
        30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate
        wings once more for 15 to 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and juices run clear, 10 to 12
        minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of
        the meat, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer fried wings to a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over wings and toss
        to coat.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
